# Working with MoveIt Studio Configuration Packages

### Overriding a Kinematics Solver Plugin

To change the Kinematics solver from the default (KDL IK) to another (such as pick_ik), add a `kinematics` override parameter to the `moveit_params` section in the `site_config.yaml` file so that it looks like this afterwards:

```python
# Override MoveIt parameters
moveit_params:
  servo:
    package: "ur_gazebo_config"
    path: "config/moveit/ur5e_servo.yaml"
  kinematics:
    package: "ur_gazebo_config"
    path: "config/moveit/pick_ik_kinematics.yaml"

```

This updates the Gazebo Site Config to use the pick_ik inverse kinematics plugin instead of the default one defined in the Base Config.

### Adding a Custom ROS Node Service to a Launch Configuration

Consider if you needed another service to be available for a custom use-case.
For example, to detect AprilTags, we could use a library like https://github.com/duckietown/lib-dt-apriltags from within MoveIt Studio.  
The first step would be to adapt this into a ROS Service, which is already finished as an example here: [../src/apriltag_ros_python/](../src/apriltag_ros_python).

To automatically make this service start on launch, we will add it to the launch file:

- launch/sim/hardware_sim.launch.py

Add this at the end of the file just before the `return LaunchDescription(` portion:

```python

    # AprilTag detection node
    apriltag_server_node = Node(
        package="apriltag_ros_python",
        executable="apriltag_detection_server",
        output="both",
        parameters=[
            {
                "visualize": False,
                "apriltag_family": "tag36h11",
            }
        ],
    )

```

And finally, add it to the node list in `LaunchDescription`:

```python
    return LaunchDescription(
        [
            # original launch descriptions
            apriltag_server_node,  # new code
        ]
    )
```

And that's it. Congratulations: an AprilTag detection service is now present in the Gazebo site config, enabling AprilTag Behaviors to work.
If you want to test that things are working as intended you can `docker exec` into the container and check the ROS 2 node and service lists:

```console
docker compose exec -it agent bash
```

```console
studio-user@moveitstudio:/$ source /opt/overlay_ws/install/setup.bash
studio-user@moveitstudio:/$ ros2 node list | grep apriltag
  /apriltag_detection_server
studio-user@moveitstudio:/$ ros2 service list | grep apriltag
  /apriltag_detection_server/describe_parameters
  /apriltag_detection_server/get_parameter_types
  /apriltag_detection_server/get_parameters
  /apriltag_detection_server/list_parameters
  /apriltag_detection_server/set_parameters
  /apriltag_detection_server/set_parameters_atomically
  /detect_apriltags
```

### Adding a Scene Camera

We now consider the example of adding a Scene Camera to the site config.
This camera will be a Realsense d435 camera and serves as an overhead camera that can see the scene of the robot.

- config/wrist_camera.yaml

We first add the configuration of the new Scene Camera to our Camera config file:

```python
- scene_camera:
    camera_name: "scene_camera"
    type: "sim"
    use: True
    # These values must match those specified in realsense_d435.urdf.xacro
    image_width: 640
    image_height: 480

    # information about the topics the camera publishes the raw image and info
    rgb_info: "/scene_camera/color/camera_info"
    rgb_image: "/scene_camera/color/image_raw"

    # By adding registered_rgb_depth_pair, this camera can be used for "Set Transform From Click"
    # Since this is simulation, assume registered image is simply the raw image.
    registered_rgb_depth_pair:
      depth_info: "/scene_camera/color/camera_info"
      depth_image: "/scene_camera/depth/image_rect_raw"
      registered_info: "/scene_camera/depth_registered/camera_info"
      registered_image: "/scene_camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw"
```

- launch/sim/hardware_sim.launch.py
We need to get the images from Gazebo to ROS. 
Luckily, there exists a package for just this thing: https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/tree/ros2/ros_gz_image  

We will add a bridge from this package for our new scene camera; one for each topic we want.

The remappings are simply to name the topics in a format that MoveIt Studio expects (specified above in the Cameras yaml).
The topics we care about are the RGB image, the depth image, and the Camera Info.

First, the RGB and depth image topic bridges are added to the launch file under the `# Camera Topic Bridges #` comment:

```python
    # For the scene camera, enable RGB image topics only.
    scene_image_rgb_gazebo_bridge = Node(
        package="ros_gz_image",
        executable="image_bridge",
        name="scene_image_rgb_gazebo_bridge",
        arguments=[
            "/scene_camera/image",
        ],
        remappings=[
            ("/scene_camera/image", "/scene_camera/color/image_raw"),
        ],
        output="both",
    )
    scene_image_depth_gazebo_bridge = Node(
        package="ros_gz_image",
        executable="image_bridge",
        name="scene_image_depth_gazebo_bridge",
        arguments=[
            "/scene_camera/depth_image",
        ],
        remappings=[
            (
                "/scene_camera/depth_image",
                "/scene_camera/depth/image_rect_raw",
            ),
        ],
        output="both",
    )
```

Next, we add the bridge for the Camera Info below these: 

```python
    scene_camera_info_gazebo_bridge = Node(
        package="ros_gz_bridge",
        executable="parameter_bridge",
        name="scene_camera_info_gazebo_bridge",
        arguments=[
            "/scene_camera/camera_info@sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo[ignition.msgs.CameraInfo",
        ],
        remappings=[
            ("/scene_camera/camera_info", "/scene_camera/color/camera_info"),
        ],
        output="both",
    )
```

And finally, we add these nodes to our `Launch Description` so they are actually launched:

```python
    return LaunchDescription
        [
            # original launch descriptions
            scene_image_rgb_gazebo_bridge,
            scene_image_depth_gazebo_bridge,
            scene_camera_info_gazebo_bridge,
        ]
```

- description/ur5e_gazebo.xacro

We will add the hardware realsense_d435 to the simulation world by adding it to the simulation world xacro.
To do this, we use the realsense_d435 xacro macro (which is found in the MoveIt Studio `picknik_accessories` package and is already included in the simulation world xacro).

To add an instance of this macro, after the `external_camera_link` definition, add:

```xml
  <xacro:realsense_d435 parent="external_camera_link" name="scene_camera" visible="false" simulate_depth="true">
    <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0" />
  </xacro:realsense_d435>

  <!-- Additional Camera -->
  <link name="extra_scene_camera_link" />
  <joint name="extra_scene_camera_joint" type="fixed">
    <parent link="world" />
    <child link="extra_scene_camera_link" />
    <origin xyz="-0.3 0.3 0.5" rpy="0.0 0.0 -3.14" />
  </joint>
  <xacro:realsense_d435 parent="extra_scene_camera_link" name="extra_camera" visible="false" simulate_depth="false">
    <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0" />
  </xacro:realsense_d435>
```

Congratulations! You should now have a scene camera displayed in the MoveIt Studio UI dropdown!
Feel free to change the location of this camera by modifying the `extra_scene_camera_joint`'s `origin` `xyz` for translation (in meters) or `rpy` for roll pitch yaw rotations (in radians).


### Cheatsheet

If at any point you got lost or just want to skip to a working feature complete config you can update your `site_config.yaml` to point to finished configs:

- wrist_camera.yaml &rarr; wrist_and_scene_cameras.yaml
- ur5e_gazebo.xacro &rarr; ur5e_with_scene_camera_gazebo.xacro
- hardware_sim.launch.py &rarr; hardware_sim_cameras_apriltag.launch.py

Or if you want to skip this straight to the finished working site_config.yaml:

```bash
cd ~/moveit_studio/moveit_studio_training_ws/src/ur_gazebo_config
cp config/SOLUTION_site_config.yaml config/site_config.yaml
```
